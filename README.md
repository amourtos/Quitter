# Quitter
Still in Beta, but basic functionality is usable.


Track how many days since you quit!
This is my first attempt at a React Native application for Android. 
The goal of the application is to help users track how many days, months, and years since they quit their addicted product.

Future goals:
I will be adding input fields that will allow users to input how much a pack of cigarettes cost them, and how frequently they purchased said pack.
The application will also be able to calculate how much money the user has saved from the selected input date. 

Thank you for checking out my app! React Native is tedious, but I am looking forward to learning more about it.
